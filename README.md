Fold with relentless elegance.

## Features
- Use `h` at the first non-blank character of a line (or before) to fold. Use `l` anywhere on a folded line to unfold it.[^1] This allows you to ditch `zc`, `zo`, and `za` â€“ you can just use `h` and `l` to work with folds.
- Pause folds while searching, restore folds when done with searching. (Normally, folds are lost when you search for some text throughout the file, which is very annoying.)
- Remember folds across sessions.

## Installation

```lua
-- lazy.nvim
{
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-origami",
	event = "BufReadPost", -- later or on keypress would prevent saving folds
	opts = true, -- needed even when using default config
},

-- packer
use {
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-origami",
	config = function () 
		require("origami").setup ({}) -- setup call needed
	end,
}
```

The `.setup()` call or `lazy`'s `opts` is required. Otherwise the plugin works out the box without any necessary further configuration.

## Configuration

```lua
-- default values
require("origami").setup ({
	keepFoldsAcrossSessions = true,
	pauseFoldsOnSearch = true,
	setupFoldKeymaps = true,
})
```

*Recommendation:* By setting ['startofline'](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'startofline') to `true`, bigger movements move you to the start of the line, which works well with this plugin's `h` key.

If you use other keys than `h` and `l` for vertical movement, set `setupFoldKeymaps` to false and map the keys yourself:

```lua
require("origami").h()
require("origami").l()
```

## Limitations
With certain formatter setups, formatting a buffer can open folds if text inside the fold was changed. This plugin does not have a feature to prevent that yet.

[^1]: Technically, unfolding with `l` is already a built-in vim feature when `foldopen` includes `hor`. However, this plugin still sets up an `l` key replicating that behavior, since the built-in version still moves you to one character to the side, which can be considered a bit counterintuitive.
