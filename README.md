The requirements may look detailed, but the plugin works mostly out-of-the-box.
If you are on nvim 0.11+ and do not have `nvim-ufo` installed, all features
except `autoFold` and `keepFoldsAcrossSessions` are enabled by default and work
without any need for additional configuration.

With nvim 0.11+, `nvim-origami` is able to replace most of `nvim-ufo`'s feature
set in a much more lightweight way.

## Installation

```lua
-- lazy.nvim
{
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-origami",
	event = "VeryLazy",
	opts = {}, -- needed even when using default config

	-- recommended: disable vim's auto-folding
	init = function()
		vim.opt.foldlevel = 99
		vim.opt.foldlevelstart = 99
	end,
},
```

## Configuration

```lua
-- default settings
require("origami").setup {
	-- features incompatible with `nvim-ufo`
	useLspFoldsWithTreesitterFallback = not package.loaded["ufo"],
	autoFold = {
		enabled = false,
		kinds = { "comment", "imports" }, ---@type lsp.FoldingRangeKind[]
	},
	foldtextWithLineCount = {
		enabled = not package.loaded["ufo"],
		template = "   %s lines", -- `%s` gets the number of folded lines
		hlgroupForCount = "Comment",
	},

	-- can be used with or without `nvim-ufo`
	pauseFoldsOnSearch = true,
	foldKeymaps = {
		setup = true, -- modifies `h` and `l`
		hOnlyOpensOnFirstColumn = false,
	},

	-- features requiring `nvim-ufo`
	keepFoldsAcrossSessions = package.loaded["ufo"],
}
```

If you use other keys than `h` and `l` for vertical movement, set
`opts.foldKeymaps.setup = false` and map the keys yourself:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<Left>", function() require("origami").h() end)
vim.keymap.set("n", "<Right>", function() require("origami").l() end)
```

## FAQ

### Folds are still opened
[Many formatting plugins open all your
folds](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/164gg5v/preserve_folds_when_formatting/)
and unfortunately, there is nothing this plugin can do about it. The only two
tools I am aware of that are able to preserve folds are the
[efm-language-server](https://github.com/mattn/efm-langserver) and
[conform.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim).

### Debug folding issues

```lua
-- Folds provided by the LSP
require("origami").inspectLspFolds("special") -- comment & import only
require("origami").inspectLspFolds("all")
```

[^1]: Technically, unfolding with `l` is already a built-in vim feature when
	`vim.opt.foldopen` includes `hor`. However, this plugin still sets up a `l`
	key replicating that behavior, since the built-in version still moves you to
	one character to the side, which can be considered a bit counterintuitive.
